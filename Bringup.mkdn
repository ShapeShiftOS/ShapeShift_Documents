##### Preparing ShapeShiftOS ROM for devices
- For building ShapeShiftOS for your device, ensure that your trees can successfully build PixelExperience as our code is extremely similar to theirs. Of course, we do require some additional overlays in your tree to make the best out of ShapeShiftOS.

If you have a device with a notch, add this to your overlay's overlay/frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml:
>>     <!-- Whether device has a physical display cutout -->
>>     <bool name="config_physicalDisplayCutout">true</bool>

If your device has an AMOLED screen, add this to your overlays overlay/frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml:
>>      <!-- Whether the device supports Smart Pixels -->
>>      <bool name="config_enableSmartPixels">true</bool>    

If your device has an in-display fingerprint scanner, you have to adapt these commits to your device (Only recommended if FOD doesn't work or has problems on your device!)
